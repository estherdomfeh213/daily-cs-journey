### **Easy Way to Remember Features of Machine Language (1GL) for Exams** 🚀  

Use the **mnemonic: "B-H-F-D-N-M-N"** (Think: **"Big Hungry Foxes Dance Near My Nest"** 😆).  

| **Letter** | **Feature** | **Explanation** |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| **B** | **Binary-Based** | Uses **0s and 1s**, understood by the CPU. |
| **H** | **Hardware-Specific** | Different CPUs have different machine languages. |
| **F** | **Fast Execution** | Runs **directly** on the CPU, no need for translation. |
| **D** | **Difficult to Write & Debug** | Hard to read and fix errors since it’s all binary. |
| **N** | **No Abstraction** | Works **directly with hardware**, no user-friendly syntax. |
| **M** | **Memory-Dependent** | Manual memory management needed, risk of errors. |
| **N** | **Not Portable** | Works only on **one CPU type**, not transferable. |

### **Quick Recap for Exams:**  
💡 **"Machine Language is FAST but HARD!"**  
✅ **Fastest execution** (direct CPU operation).  
❌ **Hard to write & debug** (all in binary).  
❌ **Not portable** (CPU-specific).
